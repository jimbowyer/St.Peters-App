Its been in use in various versions since 2015, finally got around to sharing so others can leverage.

To deploy in own dev environment:
1. Clone Repo locally.
2. Open in Visual Studio 2017 with Xamarin Add-in installed. 
     [note: solution built using VS Pro edition, recreate sln if using another edition e.g. enterprise.]
2. Restore nuget packages

NOTE: if you are using newer version of Xamarin, it targets .NET Standard Libarary and will require yo to manually upgrade/migrate.
